  abstract =   {In this paper we discuss expressive visualization techniques
               that smartly uncover the most important information in order
               to maximize the visual information of the underlying data.
               This is achieved through dynamic change in visual
               representations, through deformations, or through changing
               the spatial position of parts of the data. Such techniques
               originate from technical illustration and are called
               cut-away views, ghosted views, and exploded views. These
               illustrative techniques unveil the most important visual
               information by a high level of abstraction. The change in
               visual representation or spatial position is done in a way
               that is easily perceivable and the overall visual harmony is
               preserved.},
